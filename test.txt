Hola 
Cómo les va

El proceso que tenemos en la empresa nos ayudará a desarrollar software de una mejor manera.

Primero cambiemos el idioma a Inglés...Got it!

At first, if you're reading this, you'll understand that the first step for devops is GIT. 

Now, the second step is to understand the docker architecture.

Docker is a software tool that does application containerization which is light in weight and easier to deploy than the VM File.

Docker consists of 5 layers:

- First comes the hardware, that is the laptop or the desktop computer.
- Second. Operating system.
- Third. Docker software that you will install. Suppose you're using Windows. If u need an Ubuntu environment you could simply download the Ubuntu container form ther Docker engine via command.
- Next, you have other external libraries installedfor your code to run.
- At the last comes your application where the main code resides.
